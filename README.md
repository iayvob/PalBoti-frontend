# PalBoti – Smart Warehouse Manager

Welcome to the PalBoti repository for the Smart Warehouse Manager project! This project is part of a hackathon that brings together robotics, electronics, and web development to revolutionize sorting centers and warehouse operations.

## Project Overview

In today's rapidly evolving logistics landscape, reducing human error and operational costs is crucial. Our Smart Warehouse Manager project focuses on automating the sorting and delivery process within warehouses. The core objectives include:
- **Autonomous Navigation:** A robot capable of moving efficiently from one point to another.
- **Package Recognition:** Identifying and verifying the destination of each package.
- **Dynamic Shelf Access:** Accessing various shelving units regardless of their location.
- **Intelligent Differentiation:** Distinguishing between packages and shelves using sensor data.
- **Integrated Web Interface:** Providing real-time information, status updates, and parcel tracking through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features

- **Real-time Tracking:** Monitor the robot's movement and package status live.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** User-friendly web interface to display package data, updates, and operational metrics.
- **Robust API Integration:** Seamless communication between the robot’s hardware and the web service.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to integrate additional sensors and features as needed.
- **Error Reduction:** Automated sorting and handling to minimize human error.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Framework/Library suggestions: React.js or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express.js (or your preferred backend framework)
- **APIs & IoT Integration:** RESTful APIs and WebSocket for real-time communication
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL (or any database suited for real-time data)
- **Robotics Integration:** Integration with IoT sensors and robotics control systems
